About me
======

I am pursuing Bachelor's degree in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My supervisor is [Prof. Virginia de Sa](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~desa/) and my research interest lies in machine learning and brain computer interface. I have also worked with [Prof. Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/#) as a summer intern and did some research in data management and index search.

Research experience
======
* **Power Oversubscription in an Insecure Data Center**  
_Supervised by Professor Chao Li (SJTU), Dec. 2017 to May. 2019_
    * Designed and evaluated cyber-attacks targeting different network layers in data center
    * Identified and demonstrated Denial of Power and Energy (DOPE) attack, a new threat to provisioned data centers
    * Proposed a threat mitigation framework called Anti-DOPE, which provided 44% shorter average response time and 68.1% better of 90-th percentile tail latency compared with the existing power controlling methods

* **Towards a Generic Index for Real-Time Vector Search**  
_Supervised by Professor Bingsheng He (NUS), Jun. 2018 to Oct. 2018_
    * Proposed the generic index structure for vector collections search and a series of novel techniques including vector signature, residual sorting and dictionary initialization to guarantee the quality of the index
    * Completed the entire code work in C++ and built a demo called “AudioSearcher” for live audio streams
    * Implemented crawler, word2vec model training and audio feature extraction for data preprocessing

* **Coordinated Operation System in Distributed Virtual Reality Environment**  
_Supervised by Professor Shan Fu (SJTU), Mar. 2017 to Nov. 2017_
    * Designed the holistic architecture, especially the logic tree to guarantee the serialization of operations
    * Implemented the cooperative communication and synchronization based on Photon
    * Programmed UI design and functions including teleportation, screen splitting and ray collision using C# in Unity
